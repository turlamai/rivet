# Rivet maintainer agent contract

## Required policy discovery at each slice

Before starting the next bounded slice, refresh remote state safely and re-read
this root AGENTS file, the repository's canonical implementation handoff, and
the current [family delivery standard](https://github.com/turlamai/turlamai.github.io/blob/master/docs/PRODUCT-STANDARD.md),
[documentation language policy](https://github.com/turlamai/turlamai.github.io/blob/master/docs/DOCUMENTATION-LANGUAGES.md)
and [portfolio decisions](https://github.com/turlamai/turlamai.github.io/blob/master/PORTFOLIO.md).
Follow the corresponding Chinese links when preferred; both public user paths
must express the same promises. Product-specific plans and technical protocol
owners remain in their owning repositories.

Record the repository starting SHA and the central-policy commit/revision
actually read in the PR or handoff. A link's presence is not an acknowledgement
that an agent has read it. Existing conversations and stale checkouts do not
receive policy updates automatically: refresh these inputs at slice boundaries.
Preserve other agents' dirty worktrees; use an isolated checkout when needed,
without stashing, resetting or overwriting their work. Missing/offline policy
inputs must be reported as unverified, not silently claimed current.


Human-first. Agent-native. Local by design.

## Product boundary

Rivet keeps shared application logic in Racket and uses each platform's
first-party UI stack: WinUI 3/C++/WinRT on Windows, SwiftUI/AppKit on Apple
platforms, and GTK4 on Linux. Android uses native Kotlin/Jetpack Compose.

Do not introduce a cross-platform UI DSL, replace RVT1 with an ad-hoc
transport, or mix distribution/system services into the embedding lifecycle.
Mobile support must be described by its actual maturity: a portable runtime or
typed companion foundation is not yet a generated, packaged application flow.

### Commercial entitlement boundary

Rivet does not own product entitlements, trials, activations, seats,
subscriptions, payments, checkout, or accounts. Permit owns signed-rights
semantics; Commerce owns optional online commercial orchestration. Both are
composed by the product: `product -> rivet`, `product -> permit`, and optional
`product -> commerce client`. Rivet depends on neither Permit nor Commerce.
Update-signing keys, platform publisher credentials, Permit
credential-signing keys, and Commerce secrets are separate trust domains. The
normative local rights boundary is
[`permit/docs/framework-integration.md`](https://github.com/turlamai/permit/blob/main/docs/framework-integration.md);
do not restate it here.

Before roadmap, desktop-closeout, or mobile-delivery work, read
`docs/desktop-closeout-mobile-plan.md`. It records the current decision,
sequencing, exit criteria, evidence, and handoff state.

Treat repository state as the agent-to-agent handoff. Do not rely on prior chat
history: read the plan's **Next implementation handoff**, implement only that
bounded slice, update its evidence, run the required tests, and commit the
coherent change so the next agent can reproduce the same context.

Before editing, inspect the worktree and update the tracked branch from its
remote with fast-forward-only semantics. If the worktree is dirty, the branch
has diverged, or the remote cannot be reached, preserve the local state and
report the condition instead of stashing, resetting, or editing an unverified
base. Record the starting commit in the handoff evidence.

## Family contracts

The five-repository dependency graph, repository ownership, change routing,
release order, and trust boundaries are maintained in Keel's
[`docs/family-architecture.md`](https://github.com/turlamai/keel/blob/main/docs/family-architecture.md).
Rivet's active milestones remain owned by
`docs/desktop-closeout-mobile-plan.md`; do not copy its queue into a family
document.

Rivet and Glaze share the transport-neutral contract package `keel`. Family
packages are consumed only as published catalog packages, never vendored or
copied, and every family dependency declares a `#:version` floor equal to
the lowest version this suite actually covers; raise the floor in the same
CHANGELOG entry that raises the tested version. The weekly *Family
compatibility* workflow (`family-compat.yml`) updates family packages to
latest and runs the full Racket suite; when it goes red, adapt here or fix
upstream, and keep `main` green before starting any other work.

## Start with evidence

For changes to product interaction across native hosts, read
[`docs/agent-native.md`](docs/agent-native.md#author-the-product-interaction-contract).
The product specifies shared behavior and each host uses native mechanisms;
Rivet does not own a shared UI DSL or the product's layout/brand.

For an application project, run:

```bash
raco rivet inspect --json
raco rivet doctor --json
raco rivet acceptance --json
```

`rivet-acceptance.rktd` is the product-owned, executable definition of done.
Do not remove a requirement, weaken a suite, replace packaged behavior with a
development substitute, or refresh expected evidence merely to make a change
green. A skipped, unrun, timed-out, or wrong-platform required suite means the
work is not complete.

A change touching a guaranteed desktop capability is incomplete until the
required acceptance suites pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The local
operating system determines only which checks can run locally; it does not
reduce the required verification scope. Archive every platform leg's
`acceptance --json` report and prove the union with
`raco rivet matrix <reports...> --json`; `raco rivet verify-remote`
dispatches those legs and pulls their archived reports into the matrix from
this host when the platforms are not local (issue #287). Classify desktop
capabilities as guaranteed, conditional, or platform-specific as documented
in `docs/product-acceptance.md`.

For this repository, inspect the nearest implementation and its tests before
editing. The shared wire contract is documented in `docs/protocol.md` and
exercised by `rivet/tests/protocol-golden.txt` across Racket, C++, Swift, and Kotlin.

## Source map

- `rivet/`: public backend, protocol, resources, system, and distribution APIs
- `rivet-cli/`: scaffold, diagnostics, code generation, build, package, verify
- `runtime/`: portable C++ RVT1 runtime used by Windows and Linux
- `platform/windows/`: WinUI 3 host and native adapters
- `platform/macos/`: Swift runtime, SwiftUI host, embedding, device channels
- `platform/linux/`: GTK4 host, embedded runtime, and system adapter
- `platform/android/`: Kotlin protocol and coroutine runtime foundation
- `rivet/tests/`: Racket behavior and CLI regression tests
- `.github/workflows/`: clean-platform and embedded-runtime gates, plus the
  desktop-architecture matrix (Windows ARM64, macOS Intel, Linux ARM64)

## Required validation

Run the narrowest relevant tests locally, then rely on all platform jobs before
merging native or packaging changes. At minimum for Racket/CLI changes:

```bash
raco test rivet/tests/
```

For portable native changes:

```bash
cmake -S runtime -B build/native -DRIVET_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build/native --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/native -C Release --output-on-failure
```

For Kotlin changes:

```bash
platform/android/gradlew -p platform/android test
```

Generated application paths are `.rivet/`, `build/`, and `dist/`; do not hand
edit them. `raco rivet clean` is the scoped cleanup operation.

## Portfolio placement

Rivet remains MIT infrastructure. Products own prices and commercial promises; do not add those policies or payment SDKs to this library. Current classification and documentation rules live in the family documents linked above.
