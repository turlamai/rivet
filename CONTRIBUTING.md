# Contributing

Rivet is pre-1.0, so keep changes small, testable, and compatible with the architecture in `docs/`.

For Racket/runtime changes, run `raco test rivet/tests/`. For the shared C++ protocol, configure `runtime/` with `RIVET_BUILD_TESTS=ON` and run CTest. On macOS, run `swift test --package-path platform/macos`.

Framework-owned desktop UI adapters belong under `platform/windows`, `platform/macos`, and `platform/linux`. The Android protocol/client and native integration foundation lives under `platform/android`; it is **not** a shipped standalone Android application generator. The maintained Taskboard reference has its own first-party UI sources in `examples/taskboard/windows`, `examples/taskboard/macos-host`, and `examples/taskboard/linux`. Generated projects own their corresponding native host files. Do not move product UI semantics into RVT1 or create a shared cross-platform widget DSL. Protocol changes require matching Racket, C++, Swift, Kotlin, golden/property tests, and `docs/protocol.md` updates.

Before claiming a guaranteed desktop UI or packaging change complete, run the relevant native packaged-app acceptance suite on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** and record the linked CI artifact/evidence. A skipped, queued, timed-out, or unavailable platform leg remains unverified. Use [native UI testing](docs/native-ui-testing.md), [product acceptance](docs/product-acceptance.md), and the maintainer contract in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) rather than replacing real UI verification with backend-only tests. These gates apply to the changed capability; a documentation-only correction does not require pretending a native suite was newly run.

Prefer a focused pull request with a clear failure mode and regression test. Avoid adding dependencies when the platform or Racket standard libraries already provide the required primitive.

## Linked-checkout development loop

Apps install rivet as a linked checkout (`raco pkg install --link`). After pulling the checkout across commits that split or move modules under `rivet-cli/`, `raco rivet` can fail with `instantiate-linklet: mismatch ... reference to a variable that is not exported`, and `raco setup rivet` alone does not clear it. A half-stale cache can also make `raco rivet build` succeed while emitting wrong generated files (spurious diffs, deleted scaffolds) downstream.

After every pull, rebuild clean:

```bash
find . -name compiled -type d -prune -exec rm -rf {} +
raco setup rivet
```

See [#145](https://github.com/turlamai/rivet/issues/145) for the full symptom set.
