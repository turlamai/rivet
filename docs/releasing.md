# Releasing Rivet

Rivet framework releases are tag-driven. The repository package version lives in `info.rkt`, and every released version must have a matching `CHANGELOG.md` section.

## Framework release checklist

1. Merge the release changes into `main`.
2. Confirm the `CI`, `Embedded Roundtrip`, and protocol fuzz workflows are green on `main`. Applications built with Rivet must also compile every first-party host in pull-request CI on the same runner image class used for release; see [continuous integration](ci.md).
3. Confirm `info.rkt` contains the intended semantic version and `CHANGELOG.md` contains the matching `## [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] - YYYY-MM-DD` section (Keep a Changelog format).
4. Create an **annotated** tag named `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v0.2.0`, on the intended commit from `main` history, then push that tag.
5. The `Release` workflow validates tag provenance before publishing: the tag must be an annotated Git tag object, its target must match the checked-out release commit, and that commit must be an ancestor of `main`.
6. The workflow then validates the tag/version/changelog relationship, reruns the Racket test suite and CLI smoke check, builds the source package with `raco pkg create`, installs that **exact ZIP** into an isolated Racket user environment, exercises core modules and project scaffolding, writes a SHA-256 checksum, and only then publishes the release files.

The tag-provenance validator is also exercised in normal pull-request CI against accepted and rejected synthetic repositories. A lightweight tag, a tag on a commit outside `main` history, a missing tag/ref, or a tag that does not match the checked-out release commit is rejected before packaging begins.

The source-package smoke test also runs in normal pull-request CI. It installs the generated ZIP into a fresh `PLTUSERHOME`, loads the public Rivet modules, runs the installed `raco rivet` command, creates a starter project, and checks that the Windows, macOS, and Linux scaffold resources are present. This verifies the distributable package itself instead of relying only on tests against the linked repository checkout.

Do not move or reuse an existing release tag. If a published release is wrong, fix the repository and publish a new patch version.

## Current framework release artifact

The framework release artifact is the Racket source package (`rivet-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.zip`) plus its SHA-256 file. GitHub also exposes its normal source archives for the tag.

The SHA-256 file is an integrity checksum for the artifact produced by that release run. It is **not** currently a claim that independent checkouts will produce byte-identical ZIP files: Racket's package archiver carries source-file modification times into archive metadata. A future byte-reproducible release format should normalize that metadata explicitly and prove the result across independent builds before Rivet documents reproducible artifacts.

The tag-driven framework Release workflow intentionally does not own application-publisher certificates. That keeps framework publication independent of one developer's Windows or Apple signing identity while application signing remains an explicitly trusted publisher step.

## Shipping an application built with Rivet

Application publishers can create trusted production packages with:

```text
raco rivet package --production
raco rivet verify --production
```

On Windows, production mode requires Authenticode credentials and an RFC 3161 timestamp service. On macOS, it requires a Developer ID Application identity and a configured `notarytool` keychain profile; Rivet signs, notarizes, staples, and Gatekeeper-validates the application.

The production credentials are injected from the local machine or trusted CI environment. They are not stored in `rivet.rktd` or the repository. See `docs/production-signing.md` for the environment-variable contract and recommended CI separation.

A future Rivet framework release pipeline may publish example signed applications or installer formats, but those artifacts must use publisher-owned secrets in an explicitly trusted release environment rather than ordinary pull-request CI.
