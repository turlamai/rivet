# Architecture

Rivet is a native desktop application foundation for Racket. It embeds one Racket CS runtime in the application process and connects it to the operating system's first-party UI framework.

The central design rule is that **Racket is the shared application/runtime layer, not the widget toolkit**.

## Why not a direct Noise port?

Noise proves that embedding Racket CS in a native application can work well. Its strongest ideas are worth keeping:

- embed Racket instead of launching a separate Racket process;
- compile application code into an embedded module bundle;
- keep backend work away from the UI thread;
- use request identifiers so multiple backend calls can be outstanding;
- define data/RPC boundaries rather than sharing runtime objects across languages.

Rivet changes the center of gravity. The protocol and lifecycle are platform-neutral first; Swift and C++ are peer clients. The framework does not define its core concepts in Swift and then translate them to Windows.

## Processes and threads

A normal Rivet application has one process and one Racket CS runtime.

### Windows

```text
WinUI UI thread
    │
    ├── Backend::call(...)
    │      │
    │      └── request frame -> anonymous pipe
    │
    ├── UI remains responsive
    │
    └── DispatcherQueue <- completed native future

Racket worker thread
    │
    ├── racket_boot
    ├── load core.zo
    ├── dynamic-require app entry
    └── racket_apply -> serve-fds
              │
              ├── Racket request thread A
              ├── Racket request thread B
              └── Racket request thread C

Native reader thread
    │
    └── response frame -> promise by request-id
```

The WinUI thread never owns or accesses a Racket/Chez value. The worker thread enters Racket through the documented Racket CS embedding API. Protocol values are copied across the boundary.

### macOS

The macOS host follows the same logical model:

```text
MainActor / SwiftUI
       │
       └── Rivet client
              │
       protocol transport
              │
       Racket worker
```

The Swift implementation is intentionally not the framework's specification. `docs/protocol.md` and the Racket modules are the specification.

### Linux

The GTK4 host follows the Windows C++ contract but uses a Unix `socketpair` for the in-process RVT1 transport. Racket CS is linked statically, while the UI remains an ordinary GTK4 application. Backend completions are returned to GLib's main loop before widgets are touched.

Linux system integration is split by operating-system responsibility under
`platform/linux/system`: single-instance activation, portal global shortcuts,
clipboard, notifications, tray, autostart, secure storage, and crash/shutdown
each have one implementation unit. `system_services.cpp` only assembles public
capability discovery and activation arguments; `system_services_internal.*`
is a private XDG, D-Bus,
and low-level I/O support layer. Native applications continue to include only
`system_services.hpp`.

## Runtime ownership

Rivet treats a Racket runtime as process-scoped infrastructure:

1. the native host resolves an **exact matching** Racket CS runtime and boot files;
2. one dedicated native worker boots Racket CS;
3. the compiled application bundle is loaded;
4. the configured module and entry procedure are dynamically required;
5. the entry receives native file descriptors and calls `serve-fds`;
6. Shutdown terminates the server cleanly;
7. the host joins runtime/reader threads before native UI teardown completes.

A `Backend` object cannot be restarted after shutdown in v0. This is intentional: restart semantics for an in-process Scheme runtime are easy to make subtly unsafe and are not needed for application lifecycle.

## Transport

Windows and macOS use two in-process pipes; Linux uses a connected `socketpair`. All three preserve the same logical direction:

```text
Native request writer ─────────► Racket request reader
Native response reader ◄──────── Racket response writer
```

The protocol is not pipe-specific. The C++ runtime exposes an abstract `Transport`; Swift uses `FileHandle` over `Pipe`. Named pipes, in-memory transports, or other primitives can be added without changing RPC framing.

## RPC concurrency

The native client allocates a monotonically increasing 64-bit request ID and inserts a native promise into a pending table before writing a Request frame.

Windows and Linux share that pending-request and completion ownership through
`rivet/detail/backend_completion_registry.hpp`. The shared core owns capacity,
request identifiers, cancellation gates, future/callback completion,
exactly-once removal, and callback-exception isolation. Platform backends still
own their transports, Racket boot arguments, threads, diagnostics, and UI
dispatch. This boundary prevents lifecycle fixes from drifting between the two
C++ hosts without turning native integration into a cross-platform host layer.

The Racket server creates a custodian and lightweight Racket thread for each request. Completed responses are funneled through one writer thread to guarantee that frames cannot interleave.

Cancellation shuts down the request custodian and responds with an Error frame. Native callers never receive a raw Racket exception; errors cross the protocol as data.

## Racket backend boundary

`rivet/backend` has a deliberately small application surface: declaration
forms, Event/State operations, `serve`/`serve-fds`, diagnostics, and schema
snapshots. The registry structs, RPC procedures, mutable State cells, locks,
and request custodians are runtime-owned implementation details.

Build tools load the application in a fresh namespace, project its immutable
`backend-schema` snapshot into a Keel `app-schema`, and use that canonical
contract as the input to code generation. Generators do not reach into runtime
structs or maintain a second schema object model. This keeps code generation
deterministic and lets the server's concurrency machinery evolve without
turning internal representation into an accidental API.

The terminal-ownership state machine for active requests lives in the private
`backend-pending` module. It owns admission capacity, exactly-once terminal
claims, cancellation, and the short State-commit barrier. The transport server
owns frames, custodians, and the bounded writer queue. Direct characterization
tests cover the private state machine so lifecycle changes do not require
reaching through the public API or growing `backend.rkt` further.

Before 1.0, callers that used `registered-*` or `*-info-*` should migrate to
the corresponding `backend-schema` entry. Application State access should use
`state-ref` and `state-set!`; `state?` is available when a predicate is needed.

## Data ownership

No native language binding retains a raw Racket value across calls. This avoids coupling ordinary UI code to Chez Scheme's collector and object movement rules.

Rivet v1 begins with a small value model:

- null/void
- Bool
- Int64
- UTF-8 String
- Bytes
- List

Typed generated clients are layered on top of this codec. The current schema supports `String`, `Int64`, `Bool`, `Bytes`, `Void`, `Any`, `List`, `Optional`, named Records, and named Enums. Optional values reuse the Null/Void wire tag; Records reuse List with a declared field order; Enums reuse String with a closed declared case set. They generate native Swift, C++, and Kotlin types without changing RVT1 framing. Swift Records and Enums are scoped under `RivetTypes`, keeping schema names such as `Task` or `Result` from shadowing concurrency and standard-library types module-wide.

`rivet/keel` projects the immutable `backend-schema` snapshot into Keel's
transport-neutral `app-schema`. Keel owns the common type, schema, lifecycle,
canonical introspection vocabulary, and the in-memory objects consumed by
Rivet's native code generators. Rivet continues to own RVT1 framing, the
Keel-to-RVT1 type adapter, generated-language policy, embedded-runtime
lifecycle, and the WinUI, SwiftUI/AppKit, and GTK4/Wayland adapters. The
projection does not enable Keel's additional value tags on RVT1. RVT1 v1
Errors also remain bounded diagnostic strings, so projected commands advertise
no structured error codes until that wire boundary changes deliberately.

Migrating a Swift call site from the pre-namespace emission is mechanical
— qualify the type once:

```swift
// before: Task clashed with Swift concurrency and emitted unqualified
let task = try decode(payload) as Task

// after
let task = try decode(payload) as RivetTypes.Task
```

Products tracking rivet main should regenerate and recompile hosts after
pulling (the schema snapshot gate reports the delta); products pinning a
released rivet are unaffected until they upgrade.

Schema evolution is checked above the codec. `raco rivet schema --output` writes a versioned language-neutral API baseline; `raco rivet schema check` rejects removed or changed declarations and RVT1 version changes while allowing additive declarations. Record field order is compatibility-significant because it is wire order. Existing Enum case sets and order are also significant because an older generated client cannot decode a new case safely.

## UI strategy

Rivet deliberately does **not** provide a fake common widget toolkit in its first layer.

Windows applications should be able to use everything WinUI 3 exposes. macOS applications should be able to use everything SwiftUI/AppKit exposes. Linux applications use GTK4 directly under Rivet's [Wayland-first display policy](linux-display.md): native Wayland is the tested release path, while X11/XWayland remains a best-effort toolkit compatibility path. A future Racket declarative UI layer may map a useful common subset to each renderer, but it is deliberately outside the runtime contract and must not prevent platform-native escape hatches.

This differs from:

- Glaze: shared web UI rendered in WebViews;
- Rivet: shared Racket application/runtime logic with first-party platform UI.

## Build artifacts

Application Racket code is compiled with `raco ctool --mods` into a bundle such as `core.zo`. Transitive module dependencies are embedded in that bundle. Runtime resources are collected separately using `raco ctool --runtime` when packaging.

The host bundles:

- the exact matching Racket CS runtime;
- `petite.boot`, `scheme.boot`, `racket.boot`;
- compiled `core.zo`;
- any runtime files collected by `raco ctool`;
- the native platform executable and resources.

Target machines should not need a user-installed Racket distribution.

### Android foundation

Android remains native Kotlin/Jetpack Compose rather than a shared UI layer.
`platform/android` contains the RVT1 v1 codec and coroutine-native
`RivetClient`; it shares the protocol golden vectors and the 64 MiB payload,
nesting, node-count, UTF-8, message-type, version, and trailing-byte limits used
by the Racket, C++, and Swift implementations. The client owns handshake
validation, bounded multiplexed calls, ordered Events, State helpers,
cancellation ordering, and deterministic stream shutdown.

`raco rivet build` and `generate` emit the typed Kotlin client under
`.rivet/generated/kotlin/`. CI compiles it with the pinned Gradle wrapper and
Java 17. Projects declaring `device-rpcs` also receive a `RivetDeviceAPI`
wrapper containing only that allowlist for authenticated companion sessions;
the desktop gateway still enforces scopes. This is a tested protocol and
code-generation foundation, not yet an Android application host.
Developer-preview status still requires a JNI bridge
to portable Racket CS for supported ABIs, a generated Compose/Gradle project,
lifecycle and process-death tests, emulator/device round trips, signing,
packaging, and release automation. Wear OS is outside the current committed
platform set.

## Application services boundary

RVT1 remains limited to typed application RPC, Event, State, Cancel, and lifecycle framing. Updates, installers, single-instance routing, deep links, file activation, notifications, tray/menu-bar UI, login items, secrets, settings, logs, and crash reports live above it.

The Racket-facing modules are `rivet/distribution` and `rivet/system`. Native adapters live beside the existing WinUI and Swift runtime code and use platform-first APIs. This separation prevents distribution policy from changing the embedded runtime contract and keeps UI-thread objects under WinUI/AppKit ownership.

Commercial product rights stay outside that application-services boundary. A
product may compose Rivet with
[Permit](https://github.com/turlamai/permit/blob/main/docs/framework-integration.md),
but Rivet does not depend on Permit and does not define entitlement, trial,
activation, seat, subscription, payment, or account policy. Rivet secure
storage remains general-purpose even when a product uses it for Permit state.
Online products may separately use
[Commerce](https://github.com/turlamai/commerce) for provider events,
commercial projections, and credential delivery; Rivet supplies no Commerce
client semantics and never imports it. Provider secrets, Commerce secrets,
update-manifest signing, OS publisher credentials, and Permit credential
signing are separate trust domains with separate keys and rotation procedures.
The cross-repository dependency and change-routing rules are defined by the
[family architecture](https://github.com/turlamai/keel/blob/main/docs/family-architecture.md).

Cross-device communication is a second, explicit trust boundary. `RivetDevice`
associates every Codable request with its response type, routes
bounded/versioned envelopes, and can use WatchConnectivity through
`RivetWatchConnectivityTransport`. The default watchOS architecture is watch
UI + typed companion channel + phone-hosted backend. A desktop-hosted companion
reuses RVT1 framing only behind an authenticated device gateway that enforces a
generated API subset; it never exposes the embedded backend socket.

The companion foundation now spans portable Swift, C++, and Kotlin session
state machines plus Apple client/server transport and Windows identity,
SChannel listener, and DNS-SD publication. The remaining milestone is not
another protocol layer: it is product coordinator/gateway binding, pairing UI,
Android discovery/TLS binding, and real-device acceptance on Apple, Windows,
and Android. See [typed device communication](device-communication.md), the
active [network device channel design](network-device-channel.md), and the
evidence sequence in
[the desktop/mobile plan](desktop-closeout-mobile-plan.md).

An update crosses explicit trust boundaries: verify signed manifest, select policy-compatible artifact, download with a bound, verify signed size and SHA-256, invoke the platform installer, then either restart or execute the signed rollback policy. See [Release and updates](release-and-updates.md).
