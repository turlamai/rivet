# Project configuration

**English** · [简体中文](configuration.zh-CN.md)

A Rivet application is configured by the `rivet.rktd` file at the project root.

New projects created with `raco rivet new` include explicit release identity and deployment-target metadata. Projects created with Rivet 0.1 remain valid: missing optional fields receive backwards-compatible defaults.

Example:

```racket
#hasheq(
  (name . "hello")
  (display-name . "hello")
  (publisher . "Example Company")
  (version . "0.1.0")
  (build . 1)
  (identifier . "dev.rivet.hello")
  (release-channel . stable)
  (url-schemes . ("hello"))
  (file-associations . (#hasheq((extension . ".hello")
                                (description . "Hello Document"))))
  (resources . ("assets" "locales/en.json"))
  (device-rpcs . (current-score refresh-score))
  (windows-icon . "branding/app.ico")
  (macos-icon . "branding/app.icns")
  (dmg-background . "branding/dmg-background.png")
  (windows-license . "branding/license-page.rtf")
  (windows-installer-bitmaps . (hasheq 'banner "branding/wizard-banner.bmp"
                                       'dialog "branding/wizard-dialog.bmp"))
  (macos-min-version . "14.0")
  (windows-min-version . "10.0.19041.0")
  (backend . "app/backend.rkt")
  (module . "backend")
  (entry . "start")
  (protocol . 1))
```

## Required settings

- `name` — installer-safe ASCII project slug: first character must be a letter or digit; following characters may be letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`. Use `display-name` for spaces or localized user-facing names. Separators, `..` path traversal, and control characters are rejected before packaging.
- `backend` — relative path to the Racket backend module.
- `module` — backend module name used by the embedded runtime.
- `entry` — exported backend entry function.
- `protocol` — Rivet project protocol version. Current Rivet supports protocol `1`.

## Release metadata

- `display-name` — user-visible application name. Defaults to `name` for legacy projects.
- `publisher` — human-readable publisher used by Windows installer metadata and Apps & Features. Defaults to `display-name` for legacy projects; do not use the reverse-DNS `identifier` here. Both `publisher` and `display-name` accept Unicode but reject CR/LF, tabs and other control or line-separator characters, preventing malformed installer and Linux desktop metadata.
- `version` — application release version. Defaults to `0.1.0` for legacy projects.
- `build` — positive signed 64-bit integer build number. Defaults to `1` for legacy projects.
- `identifier` — application/bundle identifier. Legacy projects derive `dev.rivet.<name>`.

These values feed packaging metadata and generated native constants instead of
being duplicated in platform templates. Swift and Kotlin expose them on
`RivetGeneratedConfig`; C++ exposes `kDisplayName`, `kVersion`, `kBuild`,
`kIdentifier`, and `kReleaseChannel` beside the generated module/entry names.
The generated macOS host uses `displayName` for its `WindowGroup` title.

The build also stages this identity for backend code. Require `rivet/app-info`
(or the aggregate `rivet` module) instead of hardcoding a second version:

```racket
(require rivet/app-info)

(define current-version (app-version))
(define update-channel (app-release-channel))
```

`current-app-info` returns all six fields as an `app-info` value. The
convenience procedures `app-name`, `app-display-name`, `app-version`,
`app-build`, `app-identifier`, and `app-release-channel` read the same staged
metadata. Missing or malformed metadata fails explicitly; Rivet does not guess
release identity from the executable name.

## Distribution and activation metadata

- `release-channel` — `stable`, `beta`, or `dev`; defaults to `stable`. The value is signed into update manifests and must match the client's selected channel.
- `url-schemes` — a list of RFC 3986 scheme names. Packaging registers these with the native OS; the native host receives activations.
- `file-associations` — a list of hashes with an `extension` beginning with `.` and an optional `description`. Packaging emits native document/installer metadata.

These settings describe native registration only. They do not add messages to RVT1 or create a shared UI abstraction.

## Companion-device API

- `device-rpcs` — an explicit list of backend RPC symbols exposed through the
  generated companion API. It defaults to the empty list, so upgrading
  an existing project does not expose backend methods to another device.

Every name must identify a declared RPC and fit the bounded RivetDevice route
syntax. Selected argument/result types must be companion-compatible; `Any` is
rejected. Generation produces Swift request types, typed
`RivetDeviceClient` methods, and `RivetDeviceRouter.registerGeneratedBackend`,
plus a Kotlin `RivetDeviceAPI` wrapper over the authenticated Android
`RivetClient`. The Kotlin wrapper contains only the allowlisted methods; the
desktop gateway remains the authoritative scope check even if application
code bypasses generated clients.
The exported names are included in `rivet-schema.json`: removing one is a
breaking change, while adding one is compatible. See
[typed device communication](device-communication.md).

## macOS bundle localizations

Apps whose in-app strings already follow the user language declare

```
(macos-localizations "zh-Hans" "en")
```

in `rivet.rktd` (BCP 47 identifiers). Without a declaration the bundle
builds byte-identical to before, and AppKit renders every system-provided
string — About / Hide / Quit, standard alerts, SwiftUI navigation
tooltips — in the development region's language. With the declaration,
`CFBundleLocalizations` lands in Info.plist and packaging stages marker
`Contents/Resources/<lang>.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` files before signing
(no re-sign needed), so `CFBundleCopyBundleLocalizations` resolves the
user's language and the system chrome localizes to match the in-app
strings. Only declare languages the application itself already ships.

## Application resources and icons

- `resources` — a list of project-relative files or directories copied into the application resource root while preserving their relative paths. Generated/control roots (`.git`, `.rivet`, `build`, and `dist`) and symbolic links are rejected so a release cannot accidentally capture repository metadata, stale output, or files outside the project.
- `windows-icon` — an optional project-relative `.ico` file compiled into newly generated Windows hosts. A build without the key warns: the exe then ships without an embedded icon.
- `macos-icon` — an optional project-relative `.icns` file copied into the app bundle and declared through `CFBundleIconFile`. A package without the key warns: the bundle then ships without a Dock/Finder icon.
- `linux-icon` — an optional project-relative `.png` file installed as the desktop icon (`/usr/share/pixmaps`, referenced by the generated `.desktop` entry) and used as the AppImage top-level icon. AppImage packaging fails closed without it; deb and rpm warn and install without a desktop icon when the key is omitted.
- `linux-desktop-id` — an optional reverse-DNS basename for the installed `.desktop`
  file, for example `org.example.MyApp`. It defaults to the project name for
  compatibility with earlier installers. On Wayland this basename is the portal
  identity, so set it when the app uses GNOME `GlobalShortcuts` or another
  identity-sensitive portal. The value must match
  `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*(\.[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*)+$`.
- `linux-binary-name` — an optional installed executable name, for example
  `fulcrum`. It defaults to `RivetHost` so existing projects build unchanged,
  and must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`. The value flows through build,
  package, verify, the launch smoke and the generated `.desktop` entry.
- `linux-formats` — an optional subset of `("deb" "rpm" "appimage")` selecting which native Linux installer formats `raco rivet release` builds. The default builds all three; the signed tar.gz update payload is always produced regardless.
- `macos-resource-files` — a list of unique project-relative files copied verbatim into the macOS bundle's `Contents/Resources` root before signing. The motivating consumer is `InternetAccessPolicy.plist`: Little Snitch-class firewalls read it from the Resources root and surface its per-host purpose and deny consequences to the user. Names collide fail closed against rivet-managed bundle files (the packaged icon).
- `dmg-background` — an optional project-relative `.png` used as the DMG window background. Declaring it switches `raco rivet release` to the branded drag-to-install layout: the volume carries an `/Applications` symlink and the DMG window gets a fixed 660x400 geometry with both icons placed. Render the PNG at 1320x800 (2x of the window) so it stays sharp on Retina displays; the aspect ratio must match the window, and the packager downsamples the staged copy to 660x400 because Finder draws the backdrop at native pixel size without scaling it (anything else crops the layout). Keep the bottom ~28pt of the artwork clear (the window bounds include the title bar) and leave the icon-label spans free. Without the key the DMG stays a plain single-folder image.
- `windows-license` — an optional project-relative `.rtf` file shown on the MSI wizard's license page. Without the key, the release pipeline renders the repository `LICENSE` text (or `LICENSE.txt`/`COPYING`) into an RTF automatically; a project with neither ships a neutral notice pointing at the license that installs with the application.
- `windows-installer-bitmaps` — an optional hash with `banner` and `dialog` values naming project-relative `.bmp` files for the MSI wizard (493x58 and 493x312 respectively). Unset values keep the wizard's built-in artwork.

Packaged resources live under `app/` inside the platform resource root. Racket code should use `resource-path` from `rivet/resources` (also re-exported by `rivet`) instead of guessing an executable-relative path. The filename `rivet-app-info.rktd` at this root is reserved for Rivet's generated application identity:

```racket
(require rivet/resources)

(define defaults
  (call-with-input-file (resource-path "config" "defaults.rktd") read))
```

SwiftPM `resources` declarations in the macOS host package are incompatible
with packaging: `Bundle.module` looks for its bundle at the `.app` root next
to `Contents/`, which is unsealed content that `codesign` rejects, and the
generated bundle is not itself a codesignable bundle. `raco rivet package`
therefore fails closed when the Swift package declares resources. Migrate by
declaring the same data in `resources` above and reading it in native code
from `Contents/Resources/app`:

```swift
let root = Bundle.main.resourceURL   // Contents/Resources (packaged)
let dataURL = root!.appendingPathComponent("app/locales/en.json")
```

During `raco rivet dev`, the root is `.rivet/stage/app`. Windows and Linux packages keep it beside the executable as `app/`; macOS packages keep it at `Contents/Resources/app`. Native UI code can use those same platform-native locations. Set `RIVET_RESOURCE_ROOT` or parameterize `current-resource-root` only for tests and specialized hosts.

Product resources must be declared explicitly; Rivet does not infer a resource
contract from directory names. For example, a product that shares translations
and an emoji catalog across its native hosts should configure:

```racket
(resources . ("shared/i18n" "shared/emoji.json"))
```

The preserved paths are then `.rivet/stage/app/shared/i18n/...` during a build,
`app/shared/i18n/...` in Windows and Linux packages, and
`Contents/Resources/app/shared/i18n/...` in a macOS application. Native host
code should resolve that platform resource root and append the same
`shared/...` relative path. Do not copy product files into `stage/res`: `res`
is Rivet's embedded-backend area and contains `core.zo`, while `app` is the
verified application-resource contract. This explicit declaration keeps build,
package, and `raco rivet verify` behavior identical on all three platforms.

Projects created before this feature remain valid because all three settings are optional. To embed a Windows icon in an older generated host, add Rivet's conditional `RIVET_WINDOWS_ICON_RC` `ResourceCompile` item from the current host template or regenerate the host project while preserving application UI sources.

## Application data directories

Resources are read-only and ship with the application. Mutable user data —
documents, preferences, caches, databases — is written at runtime by the
product, and Rivet deliberately provides no API for it: the location follows
each platform's convention and stays under the product's control.

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\<publisher>\<name>` (roaming; use `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
  for large caches).
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier>` (plus `~/Library/Caches/<identifier>`
  for purgeable caches).
- **Linux**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/<identifier>` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set,
  otherwise `~/.local/share/<identifier>`; caches under
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache`.

Never write into the user's home root, the install directory, or
`dist/`/`build/` (Rivet-owned generated roots). The application identifier
from `rivet.rktd` is the conventional directory name.

Products should keep one small, testable resolver for that directory and
honor an environment-variable override (for example `<PREFIX>_DATA_DIR`),
so acceptance suites can inject disposable roots instead of touching a
developer's real profile — see [product acceptance evidence](product-acceptance.md)
and the native-UI launch orchestration, both of which rely on that hook.
Write files atomically (write to a temporary file in the same directory,
then rename), and load defensively: a truncated or corrupt file is a reason
to fall back to defaults (and surface a diagnostic), not to crash on
startup.

## User-visible strings: shared/i18n

Projects that show user-facing strings keep one flat single source:
`shared/i18n/zh.json` and `shared/i18n/en.json`, each a flat
`string -> string` JSON object with identical key sets. Run
`raco rivet i18n` to verify that parity contract and regenerate the
embedded host tables (`windows/GeneratedI18n.hpp`,
`linux/GeneratedI18n.hpp`, and
`macos-host/Sources/RivetHost/GeneratedI18n.swift`). Hosts look a key up
through their shipped loaders (`rivet_app::i18n::tr` on Windows and
Linux, `GeneratedI18n.tr` on macOS): the active language, then the other
language, then the key itself — so a missing or untranslated key can
never silently render as another host's hardcoded copy. Stage the
`shared/i18n` directory through `resources` when other tooling reads the
raw JSON at runtime; the embedded tables are the authoritative runtime
source. `raco rivet doctor --release` fails when the parity contract
breaks or the embedded tables drift from the shared source, and the
command exits nonzero on any parity violation.

## Deployment targets

- `macos-min-version` — two- or three-component macOS deployment version, for example `14.0` or `14.1`. The backwards-compatible default is `14.0`.
- `windows-min-version` — four-component Windows platform version, for example `10.0.19041.0`. The backwards-compatible default is `10.0.19041.0`.

The project configuration is the application-level source of truth:

- `raco rivet build` passes `macos-min-version` to both the generated SwiftUI host and Rivet's Swift runtime package through `RIVET_MACOS_MIN_VERSION`.
- macOS packaging writes the same value to `LSMinimumSystemVersion` in the final app `Info.plist`.
- `raco rivet verify` reads `LSMinimumSystemVersion` back from the packaged app and rejects a mismatch.
- `raco rivet build` passes `windows-min-version` to MSBuild through `RIVET_WINDOWS_MIN_VERSION`; the generated WinUI project uses that value as `WindowsTargetPlatformMinVersion`.

Do not edit deployment targets directly in generated `Package.swift` or `RivetHost.vcxproj` files. Change `rivet.rktd` so build, package, verification, CI, and future tooling all observe the same value.

## Validation rules

`rivet.rktd` is validated when the project loads; a bad value is an error, not a
silent default. The non-obvious constraints are:

- `name`, `module`, `entry`, `display-name`, `publisher` and `version` are
  non-empty strings; `protocol` must be the integer `1`.
- `identifier` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9.-]*$`; use it for the
  reverse-DNS bundle/application ID, not for the human publisher.
- `build` is a positive signed 64-bit integer.
- `url-schemes` are RFC 3986 scheme names (`^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]*$`).
- `file-associations` entries need an `extension` matching
  `^\.[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`.
- `resources` and `macos-resource-files` are unique project-relative paths;
  `resources` rejects `.git`, `.rivet`, `build`, `dist` and symbolic links, and
  `macos-resource-files` rejects `..` segments.
- `device-rpcs` are unique symbols using `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, at most 124 UTF-8
  bytes per name.
- `macos-localizations` is a non-empty, duplicate-free BCP 47 list such as
  `"zh-Hans"` and `"en"`.
- `windows-installer-bitmaps` accepts only the `banner` and `dialog` keys, each
  a project-relative `.bmp`.
- `linux-desktop-id` is reverse-DNS; `linux-binary-name` uses
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` and cannot be empty.
- Icon and installer-art keys enforce their extensions (`.ico`, `.icns`,
  `.png`, `.rtf`, `.bmp`) and are project-relative.

## Compatibility

All release/deployment metadata above is optional when loading an older project. Rivet preserves the 0.1 behavior through centralized defaults, so upgrading the Rivet package does not require an immediate configuration migration.

New scaffolds write the values explicitly so application owners can review and intentionally change them.
