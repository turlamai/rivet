# Embedded performance benchmarks

Rivet's first performance baseline measures the same native integration hosts used by the Windows, macOS, and Linux embedded round-trip tests. The benchmark therefore includes the real in-process Racket CS runtime, RVT1 transport, native client, request lifecycle, and State synchronization path instead of measuring a detached codec microbenchmark.

## What is measured

The integration runner accepts an optional `--benchmark` flag. Benchmark mode reports one JSON object with schema version 1 and these metrics:

- `startup_ms`: elapsed time for `Backend::start()` / `EmbeddedRacketBackend.start()`, including Racket CS startup and the RVT1 Hello handshake;
- `rpc`: 1,000 sequential `increment(Int64) -> Int64` round trips after 50 warm-up calls;
- `state_get`: 1,000 sequential `$state/get` round trips;
- `state_set`: 500 sequential `$state/set` round trips, including the reserved `$state` Event that precedes each successful response.

The report also records `platform`, `architecture`, and `configuration` so results from different execution contexts are not accidentally compared as one series. Integration benchmarks are built in release mode.

Each operation group includes `iterations`, `total_ms`, and `us_per_operation`. Every timed operation still validates its result, so a fast but incorrect run fails instead of producing a number.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "platform": "macos",
  "architecture": "arm64",
  "configuration": "release",
  "startup_ms": 42.5,
  "warmup_iterations": 50,
  "rpc": {
    "iterations": 1000,
    "total_ms": 120.0,
    "us_per_operation": 120.0
  },
  "state_get": {
    "iterations": 1000,
    "total_ms": 130.0,
    "us_per_operation": 130.0
  },
  "state_set": {
    "iterations": 500,
    "total_ms": 90.0,
    "us_per_operation": 180.0
  }
}
```

The numbers above illustrate the JSON schema only; they are not Rivet performance claims or release thresholds.

## Measuring a packaged app

`raco rivet measure` reports what a host app actually weighs, so release CI
can gate budgets instead of eyeballing dist listings:

- `raco rivet measure size` lists every artifact in `dist/` with its byte
  count. With `--budget <file>`, each artifact is matched against the
  budget file's rules — `{"rules": [{"glob": "*.dmg", "max-bytes":
  100000000}, ...]}`, first matching glob wins — and the command exits
  nonzero when any artifact exceeds its budget, so a bundle-size regression
  fails the build instead of shipping. `--artifact <name>` narrows the
  report to one file.
- `raco rivet measure startup [--artifact <name>] [--seconds N]` runs the
  launch-survival smoke (the same gate `raco rivet package` and `verify`
  use) and reports the elapsed window, so the artifact's ability to boot on
  the packaging machine is measured rather than assumed.

Both commands accept `--json`: the size report carries artifact names, exact
bytes, budgets and structured violations; the startup report carries the
artifact, required window and elapsed seconds. Human output remains the
default; `--json` emits one object and keeps the same exit status.

Per-RPC latency stays with the integration benchmarks above: the
`--benchmark` mode measures the real embedded runtime end to end, which a
detached CLI cannot reach into a packaged GUI host. A practical release
budget file lives in the product repository next to `rivet-schema.json` and
is updated in the same review that changes packaging.

## CI behavior

Every `Embedded Roundtrip` job first runs the existing correctness integration path, then starts a fresh integration process with `--benchmark`. The second step records one JSON report for that runner and revision. Starting a fresh process is important because the embedded Racket runtime is intentionally one-shot within a process and startup is itself one of the measured costs.

The benchmark harness is continuously tested: invalid results, startup failures, or a broken benchmark implementation fail the job. **The measured timing values themselves do not have pass/fail thresholds.** Shared GitHub-hosted runner timing variance therefore cannot reject a pull request merely for being slower in one sample.

The same workflow can also be launched manually from **Actions → Embedded Roundtrip → Run workflow** for an explicit revision. Read the JSON from each platform's `Record embedded benchmark (informational)` step.

## Comparing results

Do not treat absolute timings from shared GitHub-hosted runners as hard pass/fail limits. Host load, virtualization, CPU generation, runner image, compiler version, and Racket version can move results independently of Rivet code.

For meaningful regression work:

- compare the same platform, architecture, and build configuration;
- use the same Racket, compiler, and runner image where possible;
- run several samples and compare distributions or medians rather than one measurement;
- use a dedicated or self-hosted machine before establishing release thresholds;
- keep `schema_version` in captured reports so future benchmark changes remain distinguishable.

The CI reports are intended as a convenient baseline and investigation tool. Once enough history exists on stable hardware, selected metrics can be promoted to guarded regression thresholds without redesigning the integration harness.

## Scope

This first baseline focuses on runtime startup and request/State latency. Event-only throughput, concurrent RPC throughput, memory/RSS, and packaged application size are intentionally separate follow-ups because they need different sampling and interpretation. Keeping them separate avoids turning one benchmark number into an ambiguous mixture of unrelated costs.
