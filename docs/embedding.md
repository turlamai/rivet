# Racket CS Embedding

Rivet embeds Racket CS in the native application process. This document records the assumptions the platform hosts must follow.

## Source of truth

The embedding ABI is Racket's own `chezscheme.h`, `racketcs.h`, and `racketcsboot.h`. Rivet does not maintain a parallel copy of those definitions.

A native source file that calls the Racket CS API includes:

```cpp
#include "chezscheme.h"
#include "racketcs.h"
```

On Windows the native executable links to the versioned Racket CS DLL/import library from the matching Racket installation/runtime bundle. On macOS Rivet uses the matching Racket framework. On Linux the host links an exactly matching static `libracketcs.a`; `RIVET_RACKET_LIBRARY` and `RIVET_RACKET_BOOT_DIR` can point the CLI at a separately built embedding prefix.

## Exact version rule

The following artifacts are one compatibility unit:

- Racket CS library;
- `petite.boot`;
- `scheme.boot`;
- `racket.boot`;
- the Racket version used to compile/package application modules.

Rivet does not silently select a nearby release. If the requested exact runtime is not available, tooling must either build/provision that exact runtime or stop with a clear diagnostic.

This intentionally differs from development scripts that try `racket-X.Y-1` or the nearest branch as a convenience.

## Boot

The native host zero-initializes `racket_boot_arguments_t` and sets at least:

```cpp
racket_boot_arguments_t boot{};
boot.boot1_path = petite.c_str();
boot.boot2_path = scheme.c_str();
boot.boot3_path = racket.c_str();
boot.exec_file = executable.c_str();

racket_boot(&boot);
```

For packaged applications Rivet can additionally provide:

- `collects_dir`;
- `config_dir`;
- `dll_dir` on Windows for collected runtime DLLs.

Paths to boot images should contain a directory separator, as required by the embedding contract.

## Loading application modules

Rivet's application build step uses `raco ctool --mods` to create a compiled module bundle. The native worker loads it with:

```cpp
racket_embedded_load_file(core_zo.c_str(), 1);
```

The bundle includes the application module and its transitive Racket module declarations.

For a source file named `backend.rkt`, the normal compiled module name used by the scaffold is `backend`.

## Requiring the entry procedure

The native worker constructs a quoted module path and asks Racket for the configured entry procedure:

```cpp
ptr mod = Scons(Sstring_to_symbol("quote"),
                Scons(Sstring_to_symbol("backend"), Snil));

ptr results = racket_dynamic_require(mod, Sstring_to_symbol("start"));
ptr start = Scar(results);
```

`racket_dynamic_require` returns a list of result values through the embedding API. For one value, take the `car` before applying it.

## Calling Racket

Native code should use `racket_apply` as the normal entry point for calling a Racket procedure:

```cpp
ptr args = Scons(Sfixnum(in_fd),
                 Scons(Sfixnum(out_fd), Snil));
(void)racket_apply(start, args);
```

Rivet passes plain integer file descriptors rather than Racket port objects. `rivet/backend` converts those descriptors into binary Racket ports through `serve-fds`.

The application entry procedure must not allow an exception/escape to cross the `racket_apply` boundary. Rivet's `serve-fds` installs a top-level exception boundary and the server replaces the inherited `exit-handler`, so request failures become Error frames and backend-level failures are logged before transport shutdown.

## Racket values and native threads

Raw Racket values are not Rivet's cross-thread data model. The embedding API permits garbage collection/object movement around Racket calls, and retaining arbitrary raw values creates subtle lifetime requirements.

Rivet therefore uses this rule:

> Convert at the boundary; move protocol bytes/native values between threads, not Racket pointers.

The Racket worker may construct temporary symbols/pairs required to enter the application. The WinUI, SwiftUI, and GTK4 layers never see them.

## FFI and the original place thread

When embedding Racket CS behind a native UI message loop, first-time
`ffi-lib` or `get-ffi-obj` from a Racket application worker may wait for
work on the original thread of its Racket place. If the host owns that
original thread and never lets it service Racket, the call can hang even
though it succeeds in a standalone `racket` process. Killing a thread
blocked in the foreign call is not a reliable cancellation strategy.

Initialize foreign bindings before workers only where the *actual* embedded
runtime provides a serviced original place thread; an arbitrary backend
worker is not equivalent. Otherwise use a native host adapter or supervised
child process. Verify the packaged host on each supported platform rather
than inferring correctness from REPL or unit-only behavior. See the
[capability-sourcing guidance](agent-native.md#embedded-racket-cs-original-thread-ffi-loading-363)
and [issue #363](https://github.com/turlamai/rivet/issues/363).
The issue remains open pending an embedded-host regression test.

## Runtime files

Packaging should use `raco ctool --runtime` alongside `--mods` to collect runtime dependencies. On Windows, collected optional DLLs used by Racket should be made discoverable using `racket_boot_arguments_t.dll_dir` or an equivalent controlled DLL search path.

The target machine should not need a globally installed Racket distribution.

On macOS, `raco ctool --runtime-access runtime` records staged foreign-library
paths relative to the application resource root. Configurations returned by
`EmbeddedRacketConfiguration.resolvedDefault` therefore carry that root as the
backend working directory, and `EmbeddedRacketBackend.start` selects it before
booting Racket. This is a process-wide directory change, consistent with the
process-scoped, single-start embedded runtime. A manually constructed
configuration can leave `workingDirectory` unset when it owns an alternative
foreign-library lookup strategy.

On macOS, construct the normal staged or packaged layout without repeating
path probes in every application:

```swift
let configuration = try EmbeddedRacketConfiguration.resolvedDefault(
    moduleName: RivetGeneratedConfig.moduleName,
    entryName: RivetGeneratedConfig.entryName
)
let backend = EmbeddedRacketBackend(configuration: configuration)
```

The resolver checks the packaged app's `Contents/Resources` directory first,
then the directory containing the staged executable used by `raco rivet dev`.
Applications with an intentionally nonstandard layout can continue to pass all
runtime URLs to the public initializer.

## Shutdown

The expected normal sequence is:

1. native client writes a Rivet Shutdown frame;
2. `serve-fds` returns and closes its protocol ports/descriptors;
3. `racket_apply` returns to the worker;
4. the worker deinitializes the Chez/Racket runtime;
5. native reader observes EOF and exits;
6. application host joins both threads.

Startup/runtime failure paths close their native pipe endpoints so a client waiting for Hello observes EOF instead of waiting indefinitely.
