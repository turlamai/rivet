# Rivet

Build first-party native desktop apps with [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). Use WinUI 3 on Windows, SwiftUI on macOS, and GTK4 on Linux; keep your application logic in Racket and ship a real native app instead of a WebView or a cross-platform widget layer.

**Human-first. Agent-native. Local by design.**

## Start here

Choose Rivet when first-party native interaction is worth maintaining separate SwiftUI, WinUI 3 and GTK4 UIs. Racket owns shared domain logic; native hosts own rendering and OS interaction. For a shared HTML/CSS interface, evaluate Glaze instead.

[Fit, maturity, upgrades and support](docs/USING.md) · [简体中文](docs/USING.zh-CN.md)

## Quick Start

Install Rivet from the Racket Package Catalog with the `raco` from the Racket CS installation you want to embed:

```bash
raco pkg install --auto rivet
raco rivet new hello
cd hello
raco rivet inspect --json
raco rivet doctor
raco rivet dev
```

That is the normal first-run path. `doctor` checks the native toolchain and prints actionable fixes when a required component is missing; `dev` builds and launches the current platform's first-party native host.

Every generated app includes an `AGENTS.md`, an initial `rivet-schema.json`
compatibility baseline, and a `rivet-acceptance.rktd` executable definition of
done. `inspect --json` exposes a versioned machine-readable map of project
identity, backend/native UI edit points, schema and acceptance checks, target
maturity, generated paths, and safe lifecycle commands. See [agent-native
development](docs/agent-native.md) and [product acceptance
evidence](docs/product-acceptance.md).

For a guided walkthrough, read **[Getting Started with Rivet](docs/getting-started.md)**. Before shipping a product, adopt the [native-host CI contract](docs/ci.md). The installed package also includes searchable Scribble documentation. If you are developing Rivet itself, use the linked-checkout workflow in that guide instead of installing from the catalog.

After the counter, study **[Rivet Taskboard](examples/taskboard/README.md)**: a maintained list/detail application with independent WinUI 3, SwiftUI, and GTK4 interfaces over one tested Racket contract.

## Why Rivet?

Racket is an excellent language for application logic, but there is no direct path from a Racket backend to the modern first-party desktop stacks that commercial applications increasingly use.

Rivet fills that gap:

- **First-party native UI** — WinUI 3 on Windows, SwiftUI/AppKit on macOS, GTK4 on Linux
- **Racket for application logic** — macros, pattern matching, concurrency, data processing, domain logic
- **One backend contract** — typed RPC, events, shared state, cancellation, and lifecycle over the same RVT1 protocol
- **Shared application model** — project the backend schema into [Keel](https://github.com/turlamai/keel), the transport-neutral contract shared with Glaze, without moving RVT1 or native UI ownership
- **Generated native clients** — Racket declarations become typed Swift and C++ APIs at build time
- **Real-time charts** — rolling-time-series widgets on every desktop host over one typed data plane (`rivet/chart` ring buffers, gap-detected binary batches); see [docs/chart-series.md](docs/chart-series.md)
- **Embedded Racket CS** — the Racket runtime lives inside the application process; no external backend process is required
- **Exact runtime matching** — Rivet stages the installed Racket CS runtime and never silently falls back to a nearby version
- **Documented ecosystem escape hatches** — generated Agent guidance and `inspect --json` explain when to use a Racket package, a native host API, FFI, an external CLI, or an isolated sidecar, including the release and security checks for each

Rivet is intentionally not a WebView framework and not a cross-platform widget toolkit. Windows, macOS, and Linux each keep their first-party native UI and platform behavior.

### Hello Rivet

The Racket backend declares the API shared by all three native hosts:

```racket
#lang racket/base

(require rivet/backend)

(provide start)

(define-event progress)
(define-state counter : Int64 0)

(define-rpc (greet [name : String] : String)
  (format "Hello, ~a!" name))

(define-rpc (increment [value : Int64] : Int64)
  (add1 value))

(define (start in-fd out-fd)
  (serve-fds in-fd out-fd))
```

`raco rivet build` reads the RPC, Event, State, Record, and Enum schema and generates typed native clients. Swift gets methods such as `increment(value:)`, `get_counter()`, and `set_counter(_:)`; C++ gets their native equivalents; Kotlin gets the same surface in `.rivet/generated/kotlin/dev/rivet/generated/GeneratedBackend.kt` for projects that declare companion `device-rpcs` (a desktop-only project has no Kotlin consumer, so the file is not part of its fresh output set).

### How it compares

| | Rivet | Glaze |
|---|---|---|
| UI stack | **WinUI 3 / SwiftUI / GTK4** | HTML/CSS/JS + WebView |
| Racket role | shared backend | backend + local web server |
| Native widgets | **first-party OS UI** | no |
| One UI codebase | no | yes |
| Styling model | platform native | CSS |
| Best fit | platform-native commercial apps | web-tech desktop apps |

The two projects serve different trade-offs rather than replacing one another.

## How it works

```text

             RPC / Event / State / Cancel
                           │

                │        │        │
             Windows   macOS    Linux
```

Racket CS runs on a dedicated runtime thread. Native UI code never manipulates Racket/Chez values directly, and Racket pointers never cross ordinary native thread boundaries. The native side only sees framed RVT1 messages and generated Swift/C++ values.

Rivet defines an embedding model with a cross-platform runtime contract, protocol, code generation, and lifecycle instead of Swift-first.

Use the [documentation map](docs/README.md) to find the canonical guide for architecture, protocol, platform integration, diagnostics, and release work.

## Platform status

| Capability | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native host | ✅ WinUI 3 + C++/WinRT | ✅ SwiftUI + Swift | ✅ GTK4 + C++ / Wayland |
| Embedded Racket CS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ static runtime |
| RVT1 / Events / State / Cancel | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Typed generated client | ✅ C++ | ✅ Swift | ✅ C++ |
| `new` / `doctor` / `build` / `dev` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `package` / `verify` | ✅ dependency audit | ✅ signing/rpath/plist audit | ✅ directory + `ldd` audit |
| Production signing / installer | ✅ Authenticode + MSI | ✅ Developer ID + DMG | ✅ signed tarball + deb/rpm/AppImage |
| System services / secure storage | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Linux adapter + portal global shortcuts + StatusNotifierItem tray |
| Real embedded-runtime CI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Windows, macOS, and Linux are production release targets. Linux qualification
uses native Wayland and real deb/rpm package-manager transactions for install,
failed-upgrade recovery, upgrade, distro-native downgrade or rollback behavior,
launch, and uninstall;
AppImage launch is independently gated outside the build tree. X11 and
XWayland remain best-effort GTK compatibility paths, not release targets.

### Apple mobile foundation

| Capability | iPhone / iPad | Apple Watch |
|---|---|---|
| Portable Swift protocol/runtime | ✅ iOS/iPadOS 16+ | ✅ watchOS 9+ |
| Typed cross-device request/response | ✅ generated allowlist + router | ✅ generated client |
| WatchConnectivity adapter | ✅ phone endpoint | ✅ watch endpoint |
| Embedded Racket CS app host | planned portable-bytecode runtime | companion mode by default |
| `raco rivet new/build/package` app flow | not yet | not yet |

The shared Racket schema now generates a default-deny, Codable companion API and CI cross-compiles that generated surface for both iOS and watchOS. The mobile targets are still foundations, not a claim of finished app delivery: the phone/tablet embedded runtime and native SwiftUI scaffolds come next, while watchOS deliberately starts as a typed companion to the phone-hosted backend.

### Android foundation

| Capability | Android phone / tablet |
|---|---|
| Kotlin RVT1 codec | ✅ shared golden vectors |
| Coroutine runtime client | ✅ Request/Event/State/Cancel |
| Typed generated client | ✅ generated from the shared schema, compiled in CI |
| Native UI host | planned Jetpack Compose |
| Embedded Racket CS / JNI | not yet |
| `raco rivet new/build/package` app flow | not yet |

The checked-in Gradle wrapper is version-pinned and checksum-verified. Android currently has a tested protocol, coroutine-client, and typed-client-codegen foundation; JNI runtime hosting, Compose scaffolds, packaging, signing, and device/emulator round trips remain before developer-preview status. See the [Android foundation](docs/architecture.md#android-foundation).

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Racket CS](https://racket-lang.org/) | application backend and embedded runtime |
| Visual Studio 2022 / Build Tools + Windows SDK | Windows host build; Windows App SDK is restored as a project package |
| Xcode command line tools / Swift | macOS host build |
| CMake, C++20, pkg-config, GTK 4.10+ development files | Linux host build |

Rivet discovers the exact installed Racket CS runtime, boot files, headers, and native libraries during the build. Run `raco rivet doctor` before your first `dev`; when the environment is incomplete, it prints the next remediation steps instead of only reporting `not found`.

## Development workflow

Create a project and enter the normal edit/run loop:

```bash
raco rivet new hello
cd hello
raco rivet doctor
raco rivet dev
```

The generated project contains a shared Racket backend plus native Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts. Its own `README.md` points directly to the files you normally edit.

Build and package when you are ready to leave the development loop:

```bash
raco rivet build
raco rivet package
raco rivet verify
raco rivet release
```

`build` produces the native host and staged runtime. `package` turns that output into a distributable Windows/Linux directory or a macOS `.app` bundle and verifies it before reporting success. `verify` re-audits an existing package.

For publisher-signed output, use `raco rivet package --production` with the platform signing credentials described in [docs/production-signing.md](docs/production-signing.md).

`release` adds the formal installer, independently signed update manifest, SBOM, and third-party notices. The shared updater covers authenticated check/download plus native macOS bundle swap, Windows MSI handoff, and Linux AppImage replacement, so products provide policy and UI instead of reimplementing security-critical plumbing. See [Release and updates](docs/release-and-updates.md); update signing keys are separate from Authenticode/Developer ID credentials.

### Product entitlements

Commercial entitlements are deliberately outside Rivet's framework boundary.
Products that need offline-verifiable rights can compose Rivet with
[Permit](https://github.com/turlamai/permit/blob/main/docs/framework-integration.md)
or another independent entitlement library; Rivet does not depend on it.
Products that need online checkout, payment-event handling, or credential
claim delivery may additionally use
[Commerce](https://github.com/turlamai/commerce); Commerce remains a
product/service dependency, never a Rivet subsystem. Products that sell
manually or operate fully offline do not need it.
Products may use Rivet's general secure storage for credential state, while
provider secrets, Commerce secrets, product-rights signing, update signing, and
platform code signing keep separate keys and trust policies.

## RPC, Event, State, Cancel

### Typed RPC

```racket
(define-rpc (lookup-user [id : Int64] : String)
  (format "user-~a" id))
```

Arguments and results are validated at the Racket boundary. Supported schema values currently include `String`, `Int64`, `Bool`, `Bytes`, `Void`, `Any`, `(List T)`, `(Optional T)`, named values declared with `define-record`, and closed cases declared with `define-enum`. Records generate Swift structs under `RivetTypes`, C++ structs, and Kotlin data classes; Enums generate Swift raw-value enums under `RivetTypes`, C++ `enum class` values, and Kotlin `enum class` values. The Swift namespace prevents domain names such as `Task` and `Result` from shadowing standard-library types across the application module.

These type names form Rivet's declaration grammar; they are not runtime Racket
values. Runtime tooling should inspect the immutable Keel schema returned by
`current-backend-app-schema` rather than depending on a second descriptor API.

### Events

```racket
(define-event download-progress)
(download-progress 75)
```

Events travel over the same RVT1 connection as RPC responses, without opening another server or port.

### Shared State

```racket
(define-state counter : Int64 0)
(state-set! counter 42)
```

Native clients can get and set the state through generated typed accessors. Updating State emits a `$state` event so the UI can react without polling.

### Cancellation

Long-running requests use RVT1 request IDs. Native clients can cancel an outstanding request; the Racket server tears down the request custodian and returns a cancellation error without killing the backend.

### Schema compatibility

Every generated project includes the public backend contract as a versioned, language-neutral JSON baseline. Commit it and enforce it in CI:

```bash
raco rivet schema --output rivet-schema.json
raco rivet schema check rivet-schema.json --json
```

New RPCs, Events, States, Records, and Enum types are compatible additions. Removing one, changing an RPC signature or value type, changing the RVT1 protocol version, changing a Record's fields/order, or changing an existing Enum's cases/order is reported as breaking and exits unsuccessfully. Regenerate the baseline only for an intentional, release-governed compatibility break.

When `rivet-schema.json` exists at the project root, `raco rivet build` and every command that builds through it run the same compatibility check automatically before generating native clients. Keep the explicit `schema check` step in CI for a focused, machine-readable failure; projects without a baseline remain buildable but are reported by `doctor` and `inspect` as not release-ready.

## Project Structure

A generated application is intentionally simple:

```text
hello/
├── rivet.rktd
├── app/
│   └── backend.rkt
├── windows/
│   ├── App.xaml
│   ├── MainWindow.xaml
│   └── RivetHost.vcxproj

    └── Sources/
        └── RivetHost/
└── linux/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── src/main.cpp
```

You own the native UI source. Rivet owns the runtime bridge, protocol, code generation, and build orchestration.

`rivet.rktd` is also the source of truth for application identity, release version/build number, and the Windows/macOS minimum deployment versions. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

cmake -S runtime -B runtime/build
cmake --build runtime/build
ctest --test-dir runtime/build
racket_include="$(racket -e '(require setup/dirs) (display (path->string (find-include-dir)))')"

```

CI runs the protocol implementation across Racket, C++, Swift, and Kotlin; exercises real embedded Racket round trips on all three desktop platforms; opens the packaged GTK4 host through a headless native Wayland compositor; cross-compiles the portable Swift layers for iOS/watchOS; compiles the generated Kotlin client; smoke-builds, packages, and verifies generated desktop applications; and covers Windows ARM64, macOS Intel, and Linux ARM64 on dedicated clean-runner architecture gates.

The maintained Taskboard also has platform-native [UI end-to-end gates](docs/native-ui-testing.md): UI Automation on WinUI 3, AXUIElement on SwiftUI/AppKit, and AT-SPI on GTK4/Wayland assert semantic roles, RPC/State/Event behavior, screenshots, and orderly close without introducing a shared UI abstraction.

## Honest gaps

- **Linux desktop qualification is intentionally bounded** — the release matrix proves native Wayland, package-manager lifecycle, AppImage launch, and system-adapter behavior on maintained distributions. Product-specific GPU, portal, scaling, input, GNOME, and KDE behavior still belongs in each application's release evidence. X11/XWayland is best-effort compatibility, not a release gate.
- **Apple mobile delivery is foundational** — the portable Swift and typed WatchConnectivity layers exist, but iOS/iPadOS/watchOS project generation, runtime packaging, signing, and store delivery are not complete.
- **Android remains foundational** — its Kotlin RVT1 codec, coroutine runtime client, typed client code generation, and pinned Gradle build are tested, but Jetpack Compose, JNI, portable Racket CS packaging, signing, and device delivery are not complete.
- **Architecture evidence covers build/package/verify, not production releases** — clean-runner gates exercise Windows x64/ARM64, macOS Apple-Silicon/Intel, and Linux x64/ARM64, but production release artifacts are still produced by the tag-driven release flow per application.
- **No cross-platform declarative UI DSL** — native UI code remains SwiftUI/AppKit or WinUI 3/C++/WinRT.
- **Publisher credentials remain application-specific** — Rivet automates Authenticode and Developer ID/notarization flows, but certificates, PFX passwords, and Apple notary profiles are intentionally supplied by the application/CI environment rather than stored by Rivet.
- **The public API is still pre-1.0** — protocol compatibility is versioned, but higher-level APIs may still evolve.

Maintainers should follow the [API stability policy](docs/api-stability.md);
the repository snapshots every public export and tests the full Racket suite
against the minimum supported Racket release.
