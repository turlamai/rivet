;; Composes the family-wide update manifest from per-platform release legs.
;;
;; `raco rivet release` runs once per platform, so each leg emits its own
;; signed update manifest containing exactly one artifact. Multi-platform
;; products then hand-roll a merge (five repos, five schemes). This module
;; folds the per-platform manifests into one signed manifest — same
;; application identity, and one artifact per (platform, architecture,
;; installer, component) — using the same Ed25519 wrapper every client
;; already verifies. This supports a native installer alongside portable
;; ZIP/CLI payloads for the same operating system and architecture.
