;; Subcommand modules are loaded lazily via dynamic-require. Loading them at
;; the top level means any stale bytecode cache in a linked checkout
;; (instantiate-linklet mismatch after `git pull` moves modules) crashes raco
;; command dispatch itself with a raw linklet dump, before any Rivet code —
;; including doctor — can run or explain the fix. With lazy loading the
;; failure happens inside the handler at the bottom of this file, which
;; prints the working remedy. See issue #145.
