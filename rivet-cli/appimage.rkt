;; AppImage packaging for Linux Rivet apps.
;;
;; An AppImage must run on distributions older than the build image, so the
;; GTK4 stack the host links is bundled into the AppDir as a dependency
;; closure (ldd, transitively) minus the libc/loader/GL driver surface that
;; must come from the host. GSettings schemas are compiled in and pixbuf
;; loaders staged, and AppRun points GLib/GTK at them. appimagetool runs
;; with APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 so no FUSE is required on build machines
;; (CI runners exclude libfuse2 by default).
